Todo now:

actual rotation controller using look_rot as setpoint (do not rotate when doing things)
force applied when attacking
attack hit ghost_shape
threatened region ghost_shape (affect choice of parry etc)
Stats (from primordial)
refactor to Entity-component
capture the mouse
fix player friction (to zero)
switch the blend stack to a more fitting structure (like a fixed array)
opengl loading in the render_thread

Todo art:
redo combat walk animations (stance is fine)
