in Master::handleInput :
	Add mouselook

Small things could do:				Natural followups:
	try sound in sfml					- 3d sound spacialization
	frustum culling						-
	support multiple lights				- procedural lighting/sun-moon cycle
	Alpha blending...					- balance its worth agains deferred shading/many lights
	blur distance based on variance of shadow depth map to create penumbra
	
In importer:
	check for maxbones consistency (100 bones)
	
Did some threading tests...
	Issues: Need separate context with shared resources for different threads
	
Animation: Backwards walk animation

Programming:
	importer, check max bones consistency (100 bones)
	interrupt signals
	creature physics
	static physics
	model hierarchy (multiple models under a creature)
	separate skeleton loading and skinned/sub_node model loading
	find out why the pose_matrices must be transposed, but not transform matrices
	encapsulate drawing functions with attrib and uniforms as arguments 
		so that shadowmap and main_renderer do not have their completely separate
		drawing routines
	worker threads for loading from disk(but upload to GFX card from render-thread)
	
	
Known bugs/issues:
	random crashes (glm invsqrt assert not divide by zero fails)
		suspect glm::cross/glm::rotate/glm::normalize with bad arguments
		(0, 0, 0) vectors etc...
		Fix: either find root cause, or edit glm source
	Model "hierarchy" attached sword slot (not the same depending on
		walk direction... a bit strange..
